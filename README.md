# SMS Backup Reader 2

## Info

Note: SMS Backup and Restore saves emojis and other special characters in a very interesting way.

Likely, it goes back to how characters are encoded in SMS.

* If all characters in the SMS are English + a few extra, then it essentially stores them all as ASCII*
* If even one of the characters in the SMS is beyond the base character set, then the entire message is stored as UTF-16*

*Not actually ASCII or UTF-16. There are GSM semi-equivalents. Of course it's not easy.
